# BigGIS-StreamPipes
StreamPipes setup used in BigGIS

- Currently, it relies on services running internally at FZI.

# Running locally in docker
You can use docker-compose directly.
However, we also provide a simple `Makefile` for convenience with the following targets:

```
$ make

Useful targets:
 - restart : restarts all containers using a fresh config dir
 - down    : stop all containers and cleanup
 - ps      : print status about running containers

```

# Initial Setup

StreamPipes starts its setup assistent on first access.
You can ignore the "Advanced Settings".
